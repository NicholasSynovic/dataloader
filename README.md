> Python library to handle loading data from different sources for machine and
> deep learning pipelines

## About

This library simplifies machine and deep learning pipelines by migrating data
from platform-specific implementations into a generic, intermediate
representation (IR). This IR can then be exported as a structured file or as a
library-specific data handler.
